And then there are some who are merely born with arcane potential. Rarer still are those few who may perform grand arcane feats requiring great magic potential. Knowing this, one might be discouraged ever attempting to gain any semblance of arcane power for it would seem to be that magic is only harnessed by the extraordinary.
